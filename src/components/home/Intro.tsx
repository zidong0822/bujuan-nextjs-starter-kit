        <p>
          In 2018, I believed I was Mark Zuckerberg,
          <br />
          built a startup for 1 year, and got 0 users...
        </p>

        <p>
          A few years after my burnout, I restarted the journey differently: I
          shipped like a madman â€”
          <a href="#" className="text-white underline">
            16 startups in 2 years
          </a>
          . Now I&apos;m happy and earn $45,000 a month.
        </p>

        <p>
          I realized I was doing the same thing over and over: set up DNS

            on what matters: building a business
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="text-white font-medium">Avoid headaches</span> like
            emails ending in spam or handling Stripe subscriptions
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="text-white font-medium">Get profitable fast</span>
            â€”the more you ship, the more you learn, the more you earn
          </li>
        </ol>
